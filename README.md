# My Personal Project

## Solar Project Simulator


A solar power simulator, in which the users can add -


- Number of solar panels
- latitude, longitude, height above sea level
- solar panel specifications, maximum power output, efficiency
- time of the year, ambient temperature, specify if there is any shading
- battery capacity
- simulation duration
- Desired system outcomes: Priorities such as maximizing energy production, minimizing costs, achieving energy 
independence etc
- total power consumption in the house, and subtract the energy generated by solar panels with it.

This simulating software will then return the total energy generated by the solar panels, keeping in mind the
specifications. On another tab, I would implement everything related to finances, this would include the total cost of
purchasing the solar panels, and how it will benefit them by subtracting the total power consumption in the house with
the energy generated by the solar panels, to understand the potential savings.

The ui design would consist of buttons to start, stop, the simulation, captivating background to ensure a user
friendly experience.


This will benefit those people who are planning to install the solar panels, but want to optimize the cost, by comparing
the solar panels for different specifications.
